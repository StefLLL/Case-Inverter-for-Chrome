# Case Inverter for Chrome

This is a Chrome extension that turns capital letters into lower case letters and vice versa.

`Selected` text in the current active window will be converted and copied to the clipboard.

**How to use it:**

1: Select the text that you need to convert.

2: Click on the extension icon (I recommend to pin it).

3: Paste to replace the text (if the text is in an input box).

This extension does not work on the Google home page or any page with an address that starts with "chrome://".
It works on Google search pages.

**How to install the extension:**

Download the files of this extension.

Go to the Extensions page by entering chrome://extensions in a new Chrome tab.

Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.

Click the Load unpacked button and select the extension directory.

Pin your extension to the toolbar to quickly access the extension.


bYE!
